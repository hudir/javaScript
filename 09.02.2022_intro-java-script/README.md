# Variables

var  <------- - i'm the old way to declare variables.
              - got no error if declaring twice. 

    var x;
    x = 6;

- Identifiers should be meaningful and descriptive for you and the other one who maight read your code.
- Identifiers are Case Sensitive.
- Camel Case is better.
- Hyphens are not allowed in JS.
- the First Character must be a letter, _ underscore, or $ dollar sign. not a number.

let
  
    let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

const  <---- i can't be changed/reassign.

# Data type

typeof()  ----> think about me when debug

    console.log(typeof true);   //-----> we got boolean.
